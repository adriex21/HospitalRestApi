One possible vulnerability is the outdated dependencies, the current installed dependencies are up to date, but in the future if they are not updated regularly some vulnerabilities may arise.
Another possible vulnerability is an SQL injection if the app doesn't properly sanitize or escape user input. This could happen with dependencies like mongoose or bcrypt.
Authentication vulnerabilities: If the app doesn't properly handle authentication, attackers could potentially bypass authentication measures or perform brute-force attacks to gain access to sensitive data. This could potentially happen with dependencies like passport, passport-jwt, or bcrypt.
